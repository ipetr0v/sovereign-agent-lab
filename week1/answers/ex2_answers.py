TASK_A_NOTES = """
For some reason the agent only checked The Albanach and skipped The Haymarket Vaults.
Once it saw that Albanach met all constraints it decided a second check was unnecessary and moved straight to catering calculation.
Quote from the agent's thoughts: 'The Albanach was confirmed available, so that's settled.'

# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".
TASK_B_MODE = "placeholder"

# The image URL returned by the tool. Copy exactly from your terminal output.
# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.

# The prompt sent to the image model. Copy from terminal output.
TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Haymarket Vaults, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = "Because if the tool fails it returns a placeholder which can still be passed to the agent without breaking it"

# ── Task C ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
The first tool response showed that The Bow Bar's capacity is only 80, which is insufficient. So, the next step was to check another venue.

None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 guests with vegan options. The maximum capacity among available venues is 200 (The Guilford Arms), but it lacks vegan options. The largest venue with vegan options (The Albanach) only holds 180 people.

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)
# Did the agent try to call a tool?

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = """
I don't have access to real-time transportation schedules or train timetables. My current capabilities are limited to checking Edinburgh pub availability, weather conditions, calculating catering costs, and generating event flyers. For train schedules, you'll need to check a dedicated rail service website or app.

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, it's ok.
In scenario 1 the agent found an alternative for an unavailable venue.

In scenario 3 the agent honestly said that it doesn't have a certain tool.

TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
LangGraph is just a single agent which has tools.
And every next step is decided by the agent.
Rasa CALM uses explicit steps where the LLM only picks which flow to start, then Rasa executes steps deterministically.
LangGraph is more flexible but hard to predict what it will do.
And Rasa is more deterministic but more complicated.

I'm honestly surprised that the agent didn't hallucinate anything when it didn't have any fitting venues.
Also I didn't see any major problems with the model reasoning.
So it looks like agent are actually fit for doing such tasks.
